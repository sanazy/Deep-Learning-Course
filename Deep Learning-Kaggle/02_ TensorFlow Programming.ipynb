Then you will put these functions together to compare the effectiveness of various pretrained models for your hot-dog detection program.\n\n### Exercise 1\n\nWe want to distinguish whether an image is a hot dog or not. But our models classify pictures into 1000 different categories. Write a function that takes the models predictions (in the same format as `preds` from the set-up code) and returns a list of `True` and `False` values.\n\nSome tips:\n- Work iteratively. Figure out one line at a time outsie the function, and print that line's output to make sure it's right. Once you have all the code you need, move it into the function `is_hot_dog`. If you get an error, check that you have copied the right code and haven't left anything out.\n- The raw data we loaded in `img_paths` had two images of hot dogs, followed by two images of other foods. So, if you run your function on `preds`, which represents the output of the model on these images, your function should return `[True, True, False, False]`.\n- You will want to use the `decode_predictions` function that was also used in the code provided above. We provided a line with this in the code cell to get you started.\n\n\n","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Experiment with code outside the function, then move it into the function once you think it is right\n\ndef is_hot_dog(preds):\n    '''\n    inputs:\n    preds_array:  array of predictions from pre-trained model\n\n    outputs:\n    is_hot_dog_list: a list indicating which predictions show hotdog as the most likely label\n    '''\n    decoded = decode_predictions(preds, top=1)\n    \n    arr = []\n    for d in decoded:\n        if d[0][1] == 'hotdog':\n            arr.append(True)\n        else:\n            arr.append(False)\n    return arr\n# Check your answer\nq_1.check()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"If you'd like to see a hint or the solution, uncomment the appropriate line below.\n\n**If you did not get a working solution, copy the solution code into your code cell above and run it.
